## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Skills manifest support under `.speckeep/skills/manifest.yaml` with CLI commands:
  - `speckeep add-skill`, `speckeep list-skills`, `speckeep remove-skill`
  - `speckeep install-skills`, `speckeep sync-skills`
  - grouped subcommands: `speckeep skills install`, `speckeep skills sync`
- Skill sources:
  - local directories via `--from-local`
  - git sources via `--from-git` with required pinned `--ref` (tag/commit)
- Git skill materialization:
  - clone + checkout into `.speckeep/skills/checkouts/<id>`
  - stored `resolved_commit` and `checkout_dir` in manifest entries
- Skills validation in `doctor` (manifest consistency, refs, local paths, checkout state)
- Skills section in managed SpecKeep block in `AGENTS.md`
- Sync path for skill artifacts (`refresh` + dedicated `sync-skills`)
- Optional install skip flag for mutation commands:
  - `speckeep add-skill --no-install`
  - `speckeep remove-skill --no-install`

### Changed

- Workflow chain now treats inspect as optional gate:
  - `constitution → spec → [inspect, optional] → plan → tasks → implement → verify → archive`
  - if inspect report exists, it must remain valid and non-blocking
- `add-skill`/`remove-skill` now auto-install/reconcile skills in target agent folders by default
- Documentation updated (EN/RU): README and CLI docs for skills lifecycle, git pinning, install/sync commands, and optional inspect

## [v0.1.0] - 2026-04-16

### Added

- Initial release of the Speckeep CLI (specification-driven development kit for agents and humans)
- Canonical workspace under `.speckeep/` with file-based artifacts (specs, plan packages, reports, scripts, templates)
- Strict phase chain: `constitution → spec → inspect → plan → tasks → implement → verify → archive`
- Bilingual templates/prompts: English (`en`) and Russian (`ru`)
- Shell support: `sh` and `powershell`
- Core CLI:
  - `speckeep init`, `speckeep refresh`, `speckeep doctor`
  - `speckeep list-specs`, `speckeep show-spec`, `speckeep check`, `speckeep trace`
  - `speckeep feature`, `speckeep feature repair`, `speckeep features`, `speckeep migrate`
  - `speckeep export`, `speckeep demo`, `speckeep archive`, `speckeep list-archive`
- Managed agent integrations (generated wrapper files + prompts) for: Claude, Codex, Copilot, Cursor, Kilocode, Trae, Windsurf, Roocode, Aider
- Phase readiness scripts and internal CLI plumbing (`__internal`) to keep wrappers cheap and deterministic
- Stable IDs for traceability: `RQ-*`, `AC-*`, `DEC-*`, `T*` + acceptance coverage mapping (`AC-* -> T*`)
- Migration support from legacy `.draftspec/` workspace into `.speckeep/` (safe move/copy + path canonicalization)
- Extended `CheckInspectReady`: detects `[NEEDS CLARIFICATION]` markers, counts `RQ-*` IDs, warns on missing `## Assumptions` section, checks constitution language policy consistency
- Extended `CheckVerifyReady`, `CheckImplementReady`, `CheckTasksReady`: optional `summary.md` presence warning, `Touches:` file existence check, plan content validation (`DEC-*` IDs, `## Acceptance Approach`, `## Constitution Compliance`, AC alignment)
- Stricter verify report traceability: requires `## Checks` section with `task_state` and per-AC `acceptance_evidence` entries
- Package-level tests for `featurepaths` (17 tests) and `gitutil` (7 tests)
- Full workflow integration test (`TestFullWorkflowCycle`) covering the complete lifecycle from `init` through archive-readiness in a temporary directory
